# Character Generator Challenge

My participation to the [PyGame](http://www.pygame.org/) challenge "[Character Generator](https://www.reddit.com/r/pygame/comments/7w8c4j/challenge_character_generator/)"
where the goal is to create a character generation GUI for an RPG-like game.

## Features

> TODO

## Prerequisites

Python 3. May eventually works with Python 2 (not tested).

## Installation

Clone this repo, and then the usual `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage

```
python run.py
```

### How it works

I obviously can't explain how it works here, so you'll have to jump yourself in the source code. Start with the entry
point, `run.py`.
